This folder contains instructions and associated files for building
a very basic media player on an Odroid-XU3. The media player is
built from mplayer/ffmpeg and youtube-dl. This system uses u-boot
for the bootloader and BuildRoot for building the root filesystem.
The instructions will build the kernel and u-boot from the Hardkernel
repositories, external to BuildRoot.

These procedures were written to be executed on an Ubuntu 15.04 x86
desktop. The target system will be placed onto a microSD that will
boot the Odroid-XU3. Alternatively, the system can be transfered to
the Odroid-XU3 remotely. There is no requirement to preform software
development on the Odroid-XU3 itself. The Odroid-XU3 will not require
a previously installed system.

 # The following notes how Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins repository
   was split from it's original directory:
   https://github.com/glscantlen/instructions/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer

 - Create a new, empty (no README) repository online with github:
   https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins. Then
   use "git subtree split" to extract the Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer
   folder into a branch that will be pushed onto the new repository.

    $ cd instructions
    $ git subtree split --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer --annotate="(split)" -b split
    $ git push https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git split:master
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git
    $ cd Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins
    $ git branch BR-2015.05
    - Stay in the "master" branch
    - Edit this Readme and commit.
    - push the master and BR-2015.05 branchs onto the new repository.
    $ git push --all -u

 # The intent is to create a new repository specifically for
   Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer, with tags and branches to support
   different versions of Buildroot. The first branch, BR-2015.05
   is maintained for merging in with the instructions repository.

 - prepare and test "instructions" for pulling and pushing the subtree,
   Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.

    $ cd ../instructions
    $ git rm -r Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer
    $ git commit -am "Replace Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer with subtree from Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins"
    $ git show-ref --verify refs/heads/split
    $ git branch -D split
    $ git subtree add   --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer  ../Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins  af2ea837d085b8d4f16db0c2b0f5c9c06367b119
    $ git subtree pull  --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer  https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git  BR-2015.05

 # update the github repository
    $ git push


 ! Note: should've used "--rejoin" in split and 'git subtree push'
    $ git subtree split --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer  --annotate="(split)"  --rejoin
    $ git subtree push  --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer  https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git  master
    - Clone, branch, edit, commit, and push Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins
    $ git subtree pull  --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer  https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git  BR-2015.05

 # Example for pushing commits out of the original "instructions":
    $ git subtree push  --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer  some/other/repo  BR-2015.05
