This folder contains instructions and associated files for building
a very basic media player on an Odroid-XU3. The media player is
built from mplayer/ffmpeg and youtube-dl. This system uses u-boot
for the bootloader and BuildRoot for building the root filesystem.
The instructions will build the kernel and u-boot from the Hardkernel
repositories, external to BuildRoot.

These procedures were written to be executed on an Ubuntu 14.04 x86
desktop. The target system will be placed onto a microSD that will
boot the Odroid-XU3. Alternatively, the system can be transfered to
the Odroid-XU3 remotely. There is no requirement to preform software
development on the Odroid-XU3 itself. The Odroid-XU3 will not require
a previously installed system.

 # This instruction was split from the original in:
   https://github.com/glscantlen/instructions/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer

 - Created a new, empty (no README) repository in github:
   https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins
   Use "git subtree split" to extract the Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer folder
   into a separate branch that will be pushed onto the new repository.

    $ cd ~/instructions
    $ git subtree split --prefix=Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer --annotate="(split)" -b split
    $ git push https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git split:master
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins.git
    $ cd ~/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins
    $ git branch BR-2015.05
    - Stay in the "master" branch
    - Edit this Readme and commit.
    - push the master and BR-2015.05 branchs onto the new repository.
    $ git push --all -u

 # The intent is to create a new repository specifically for
   Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer, with tags and branches to support
   different versions of Buildroot. The first branch, BR-2015.05
   is maintained for merging in with the instructions repository.
